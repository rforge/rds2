                        Snowball matrix for rds2 package
                        Degrees of individuals sampled at each period.
                        Simulated snowball sample with no dropouts.
comparison              Compares the output of the optimizaton for
                        different initialization values.
compute.S               Compares the output of the optimizaton for
                        different initialization values.
estimate.rds2           Same as estimate.rds, but for a fixed theta.
estimate.rds3           Main function in rds2 package. Returns the ML
                        estimate of population size and degree
                        distribution.
inv.qnorm.theta         Inverts the map of theta to the real line.
make.Sij                Make the Sij matrix assuming no droouts from
                        the snowball
qnorm.theta             Maps the theta parameter to the real line.
rds2-package            Population size estimation for despondant
                        driven sampling
sum.ranks               Utility functions for creating snowball matrix.
